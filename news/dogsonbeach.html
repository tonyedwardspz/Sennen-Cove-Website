                    We holiday in Sennen twice a year and only go before Easter or after the end of September so we can take our dog on to the beach.Yes I agree there are some dog owners who don't clean up after their dogs, but most do.
We ve come across used nappies litter and discarded broken bottles which are left by families. 
Could I start a ban badly behaved families with children from the beach campaign? 
Let dogs on the beach all year and get rid of this ridiculous ban!!!!<br>Dona - 18th October, 2013

                <h2>Legalities of the ban</h2>
                <p>After seeing the post, Richard got in touch</p>
                
                <blockquote>Banning dogs from beaches is unenforceable. And anyway the term "beach" only relates to the portion of the shore above Mean high tide level. Everything that is seawards of this is "The foreshore". Banning dogs from this area would require an act of parliament. Even then it would just be a legal statute and not lawfully enforceable.<br>Richard - 21st September, 2013

                <p>Its clear that theres a strong feeling on both sides of the dog ban. Do you have a comment you'd like to share? Send us <a href="../contact.html" title="Submit a news story">a message</a>.</p>
