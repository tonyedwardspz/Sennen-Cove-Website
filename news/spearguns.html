                <p>In the past two weeks there has been three sighting of people spear fishing. They're setting off from Sennen Harbour and beach, heading out along the coast.</p>

                <blockquote>Saddened to see a couple of blokes strapping knives to their legs and taking spear guns into the water. Never seen this before locally but have <span class="bold">seen the after effects</span> of it in Spain, ragged, half dead fish. What a waste and what shame people feel the need to take this sort of gear to such a beautiful beach.<br>Paul - 15th August, 2013</blockquote>

                <blockquote>I can't speak for all UK spear fishermen but myself and others I know are very careful to select specific species (mainly bass, mullet and flatfish), adhering to the minimum size limits and <span class="bold">taking only a sensible number</span>. There is no better way of selecting your catch without damaging or destroying any other fish.</blockquote>

                    Generally the visibility in <span class="bold">Cornwall is superb</span> so it it possible to have some really relaxing dives even if <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKaPMhtpLhs&app=desktop" title="Sennen Bass fishing on YouTube">no target fish are encountered</a>. We returned home today after a lovely week in Cornwall. I managed to dive this morning and took a total of two shots. The second hit and its dinner for tonight. The reason for <span class="bold">carrying a knife</span> is to dispatch the fish quickly and efficiently. It also acts as a piece of safely equipment in case the diver gets caught in anything.<br>George - 31 August, 2013

                <blockquote>Hi, thanks for putting the other side of the case, interesting to read and well put, you sound a pretty sensible bloke. Sadly, I've seen the irresponsible side of their use ...damage and danger caused by kids and the guys at Porthchapel who I did speak to and were frankly, clueless... and that's the point I was making but I guess it's true in all activities, the responsible suffer for the actions of the irresponsible.<br>Paul - 19th September, 2013
